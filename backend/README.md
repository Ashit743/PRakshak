Setting Up Flask:
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but highly recommended):
Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.

Run the following command to create a virtual environment named venv:
    python3 -m venv venv
    Activate the virtual environment:

        On macOS/Linux:
        source venv/bin/activate

        On Windows:
        venv\Scripts\activate
Install flask
    pip install flask

flask run
